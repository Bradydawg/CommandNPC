# CommandNPC Changelog v2.1.0
**This update for CommandNPC brings a few new features, and fully adds support for some old ones, so let's dive right in!**

## Added Features/Updates:
- I added an update checker, this will automatically check for updates. It can be disabled in the config file, but will require regeneration of the config file IF you want the option to disable it.
- The API version has been set down to 1.13, as it used to be at 1.16, and we are going to keep it set to 1.13 for as long as we can. This basically means that you can run our plugin on Spigot 1.13+

If you have any troubles or would like to let us know of bugs, issues can be created here: https://github.com/Bradydawg/CommandNPC/issues
