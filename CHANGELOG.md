# CommandNPC Changelog v2.1.3
**Updates the plugin to 1.19.3**

## Added Features/Updates:
- Really didn't change much. I'm aware some users have requested new features, and I'll be looking into adding those soon, really just wanted to update the pom.xml and make sure the plugin still worked. I apologize for the lack of updates and basically radiosilence, I had to take a break from everything, but I'm hoping to be back in my full capacity.
